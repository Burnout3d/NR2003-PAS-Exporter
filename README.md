# NR2003 PAS Exporter (WIP)
This is a Blender file export script for writing to Papyrus ASCII Scene (PAS) format. 

## Features
The ability to export to Papyrus ASCII Scene (PAS) format for use with make3do to compile the model to a 3do. 

##Notes
This is not fully functional yet. And it does require a very specific node group that I've made in Blender for it to function.
